### Maps of R User Groups Around the World

This shiny app is my submission to the [visualization contest](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/06/contest-prizes-for-best-r-user-groups-plot.html) held by Revolution Analytics. The app is currently hosted on [blenditbayes.shinyapps.io/rugsmaps](https://blenditbayes.shinyapps.io/rugsmaps/). 

You can also run this app locally on your machine using the following code:

```
install.packages("shiny")
shiny::runGitHub("woobe/rugsmaps")
```

### Code Freeze

**NOTE**: As this RUGSMAPS app is my final submission to the contest, a code freeze is necessary. But it does not mean the RUGSMAPS development has stopped. Please find further changes and improvements in the new [RUGSMAPS2 repository](https://github.com/woobe/rugsmaps2).
